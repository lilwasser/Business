## Project Proposal Template
Before you start project work for a course, you should be able to complete the following proposal template, addressing the questions listed as completely as possible. However, keep in mind that throughout the design iterations of your project, many parts of it will likely change (i.e. increase/decrease in number of samples, types of features or algorithm used, etc), so this is just a starting point. Also, if you are unsure in some areas, you should still submit a partial proposal to receive feedback from instructors.

In addition to submitting this plan, you may discuss the areas below with an instructor in a scope meeting.

### Question/need:
#### What is the framing question of your analysis, or the purpose of the model/system you plan to build?
The Mayo Clinic has seen a decrease in the number of cervical cancer cases in the US, but each year this type of cancer kills about 4,000 women in the US. They want to reduce the strain on medical services by offering resources to patients to see if they are at risk for this disease before being seen by a specialist. 

How can the Mayo Clinic reduce the number of screening sessions for cervical cancer during yearly check-ups to better serve patients during their appointments?
(Goal = have women do a self-check or be screened by other hospital staff to not waste doctorâ€™s time)

#### Who benefits from exploring this question or building this model/system?
Patients (save time to bring up other questions/concerns during their 15-min appointments)
Medical staff (save time during quick appointments and rule out disease much faster)
### Data Description:
#### What dataset(s) do you plan to use, and how will you obtain the data?
Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/loveall/cervical-cancer-risk-classification
#### What is an individual sample/unit of analysis in this project? What characteristics/features do you expect to work with?
Features: age, smokes, pregnancies, # sexual partners, contraceptive, previous STD
#### If modeling, what will you predict as your target?
### Tools:
Google Sheets
#### How do you intend to meet the tools requirement of the project?
#### Are you planning in advance to need or use additional tools beyond those required?
### MVP Goal:
#### What would a minimum viable product (MVP) look like for this project?
MVP: Build a predictive model of cervical cancer risk to inform patients when to seek out a specialist.
