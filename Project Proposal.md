## Project Proposal Template

### Question/need:
#### What is the framing question of your analysis, or the purpose of the model/system you plan to build?

The market size of the Supermarkets & Grocery Stores industry in the US has grown 2.7% per year on average between 2017 and 2022. This steady increase implies that competition has risen as well. This Kaggle dataset has 3 months of data on 3 different branches of a supermarket company.

My client is supermarket company Brooklyn Fare. They want to know what goods customers are buying, how they're paying for groceries, and how much people are spending on a grocery run in order to prepare for their grand opening in New York City.

### Question: 
How can Brooklyn Fare understand what goods customers are buying, how they're paying for groceries, and how much people are spending on a grocery run in order to prepare for their grand opening?

GOAL = get an understanding for how to price goods, whether to primarily market to M/F shoppers, what categories of goods customers are shopping for, how they're paying for goods (cash/card), what contributes to customer satisfaction.

#### Who benefits from exploring this question or building this model/system?

Grocery stores that are wanting to market themselves against competition.
