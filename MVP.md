## Supermarket Analysis
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The goal of this project is to better understand customer segmentation so the supermarket knows what to sell & in what quantities, and how much each consumer spends on each good. This will ultimately help supermarkets be more efficient in marketing and pricing goods against competition and lead to higher profits.

This figure depicts the count of customers that purchase each type of products sold. Fashion Accessories is the type of product that sells the most, wheras the Health & Beauty category have the fewest sales.

I will use linear regression to predict price per product.
