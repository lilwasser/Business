## Abstract

The goal of this project is to use a clustering model to determine customer segments and achieve higher profit margins. I worked with supermarket data from Kaggle in order to help my client, Trader Joe's, better understand their customers so they know what products to sell and when to anticpate busy/slow periods in order to increase their profits. After refining a model, I built an interactive dashboard to visualize and communicate my results using Tableau. 

## Design

The market size of the supermarket/grocery store industry in the US has grown 2.7% per year on average between 2017 and 2022. This steady increase implies that competition has risen as well. A single supermarket chain can see upwards of 3500 customers per day and a typical American visits the supermarket 1.6 times per week. 

My target client is Trader Joe's, a large supermarket chain with over 500 lcations in the US and annual sales estimated to be nearly $14 billion. The growth of supermarkets in cities is increasing, along with market competition, and supermarkets must establish clear points of differentiation in order to survive and keep profit margins high.

I want to help Trader Joe's better understand their customers so they know what products to sell and when to anticpate busy/slow periods in order to increase their profits. I explored Kaggle and found a dataset on supermarket sales, which I used in order to optimize for profits. I analyzed various features: Customer type, Gender, Product line, Unit price, Quantity, Tax, Total price, Payment type, Cost of goods sold, Gross margin percentage, Gross income, and Customer Rating.


## Data

Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/aungpyaeap/supermarket-sales

## Algorithms

I started off by looking at my data in Google Sheets and performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis to narrow down the key features for subsequent visualization. I used Python packages (matplotlib and seaborn) to create basic charts and exported a cleaned up csv into Tableau for more advanced visualizations to address my client's problems.

*
    * Impact hypothesis
    * Solution paths
    * Measures of success, both technical and non-technical
    * Risks and assumptions 
    
* Clearly outline the future data science steps that were not covered in your preliminary analysis
* Communicate your proposal and preliminary findings in a 5 minute mock "pitch" presentation

scoping: who was it designed for? identify places for improvement/new opps. come up with problem. impact focused ideas.
-> identify impact (obstacle/opportunity), potential impact hypothesis, major risks
* Students will deliver a **5 minute slide presentation** at the end of the course to "pitch" their project and share the results of the preliminary analysis to the client. The target audience should be a person or team within the client organization who would be interested in this project. 
 Supermarkets have a universal assortment of food porducts and non-food items that meet daily demand of customers. 

Customer demand ( It is the responsibility of the grocery store manager to understand what the customer expects and to deliver the results they require. 
what do customers want out of their shopping experience?
The growth of supermarkets in most populated cities are increasing and market competitions are also high.

## Communication
My analysis will be presented in Google Slides using visualizations created with Tableau and Python. See GitHub repository for project files and code.
