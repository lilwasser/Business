# Business Course Project Introduction

## Summary

Deliver a well-scoped project proposal and preliminary analysis to your target organization (“client”) to try to get your foot in the door. Your job is to:
* Define a realistic business problem faced by your client
* Develop a fully-scoped proposal for how data science methods can be used to drive impact towards the defined problem, 
making use of the [project identification](../applications-opportunities) and [scoping](../project-scoping) best practices 
covered in lecture. At the very least, components should include:
    * Impact hypothesis
    * Solution paths
    * Measures of success, both technical and non-technical
    * Risks and assumptions
* Identify one or more publicly-accessible datasets relevant to your proposal and perform a preliminary analysis of the data, e.g. descriptive / exploratory analysis and visualizations. This analysis should explain the nature of your data and provide evidence that your proposed data science project is a feasible solution to the problem.
* Clearly outline the future data science steps that were not covered in your preliminary analysis
* Communicate your proposal and preliminary findings in a 5 minute mock "pitch" presentation at the end of week 2 and in
 a short written description (more details below)

scoping: who was it designed for? identify places for improvement/new opps. come up with problem. impact focused ideas.
-> identify impact (obstacle/opportunity), potential impact hypothesis, major risks




### Your backstory

The client organization can be real or imaginary, a private company or a social sector group, anything you desire. 
The [brainstorming_examples.md](brainstorming_examples.md) document contains examples of clients and potential business problems, as well as other
business questions to consider when brainstorming.

Above: The clearly defined client backstory is exceptionally creative and involved, and is addressed in a highly proficient manner. The project is designed around a highly realistic and meaningful business problem that seamlessly incorporates data science methods as part of the solution. Project identification and scoping best practices are executed comprehensively.



## Components
Metis projects are broken down into 5 component parts -- **design, data, algorithms, tools, and communication** -- that 
are each scored individually. Below is a description of each component as it relates to this project. For more detail 
on how these components are graded and how extra points are rewarded, refer to the [project success guide](./project_success_guide.md).  


### Design:
*  The project should include a clearly defined backstory that satisfies a specific need for the client organization. 
It should be centered around a meaningful business problem that can be addressed with data science methods. 
The proposed project should be fully scoped out and then pitched during the slide presentation.
*  All **deliverable deadlines should be met**, reflecting **professionalism** and **effective scoping and workflow**.

### Data:
* The data must be in tabular form, so that you can use spreadsheet tools and Tableau to access the data.
* Datasets should be reasonably large, e.g. over **1,000 rows** and **10 columns**. Consult with an instructor if you are considering deviating from this rule of thumb, which is often fine. However, data should not exceed **100,000** rows, because this much data will make it difficult for Excel to function properly. If your data source has more rows than that, you should take a random sample. 
* You are welcome and encouraged to incorporate any additional, relevant data sources.
* Above: The data is large in scale and complex in nature. Multiple datasets are leveraged via merging disparate sources, enabling a broader and deeper analysis of the client problem.


 
### Algorithms:
* Perform a thorough exploratory analysis in Excel and Tableau; 
clean, explore, aggregate, and visualize the data as appropriate to address the client's problem. 
Above: Exploratory data analysis and visualization techniques are applied to an exceptional level of depth or breadth. Non-obvious patterns and insights obtainable from the data are extracted and interpreted using methods beyond what was covered in the course. The analysis clearly demonstrates the feasibility and fit of the proposed data science project to the client problem.



### Tools:
* **Exploratory data analysis in Excel or Google Sheets** is required.
* **Visualization in Tableau** is required. Note: As detailed in the Tableau lesson, Linux users will need to sign up 
for a free trial of Tableau Online. Please reach out to an instructor if you run into any issues with this requirement.
- Other tools not covered in the course are completely optional:
  - *Acquisition* tools could include web scraping libraries or use of APIs
  - *Storage* tools could include SQL or noSQL (e.g. MongoDB) databases
  - **You may use Python for data acquisition if you wish (not required), but, otherwise please do your work in sheets and Tableau and do not use Python.** Once you have completed significant work using sheets and Tableau, you can meet with an instructor, who can approve using Python for modeling and/or additional visualization.

### Communication:
* Students will deliver a **5 minute slide presentation** at the end of the course to "pitch" their project and share the results of the 
preliminary analysis to the client. The target audience should be a person or team within the client organization who would be 
interested in this project. The presentation should be given in a compelling, 
clear manner and include effective visuals for communicating your objectives and findings. 
* You will also submit a **~1 page written description** summarizing your work: it should begin with a **~100 word abstract**
to be followed by a breakdown of your project along the 5 major components.
  

## Deliverables:

**Please submit all project deliverables through the [Student Submissions Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeM7MPx5r_FaX6ordJGkG1ObLh94GEE8qzlvEFxfvmWsKmXNA/viewform)**. All project deliverables and code should be uploaded to a personal, project-specific GitHub repository. Click [here](https://github.com/thisismetis/Metis_Fundamentals/tree/main/git_and_github) for instructions on how to set up a personal repo. 

**For exact deliverable dates, refer to the main schedule [here](/README.md).**
  
**For exact deliverable details, refer to the (linked) Metis Fundamentals project deliverable templates**.
